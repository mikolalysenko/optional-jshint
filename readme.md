# optional-jshint

Pretty much the same thing as jshint, except it only runs if you have a .jshintrc file defined.  This is for those cases when you are working with clients or in a corporate environment that demands specific style guidelines.

(I don't expect that anyone else will ever use this, but I'm saving it here so that if I ever need to reconfigure my system I can grab it)
